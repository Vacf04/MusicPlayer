# MusicPlayer

A simple music player project built with React.js, using CSS Modules, TypeScript and Vite. Since I couldn't find any suitable music APIs to integrate, I decided to use MP3 files to demonstrate the player's functionality. Inspired by Spotify, this player includes similar features.

## FEATURES

- Responsive Design.
- Music Controls: Skip, Rewind, Play, and Pause.
- Volume Control.
- Simple Menu for Song Selection.
